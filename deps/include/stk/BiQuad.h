/*! \class BiQuad
    \brief STK biquad (two-pole, two-zero) filter class.

    This class implements a two-pole, two-zero digital filter.
    Methods are provided for creating a resonance or notch in the
    frequency response while maintaining a constant filter gain.

    Formulae used calculate coefficients for lowpass, highpass,
    bandpass, bandreject and allpass are found on pg. 55 of
    Udo ZÃ¶lzer's "DAFX - Digital Audio Effects" (2011 2nd ed).   

    by Perry R. Cook and Gary P. Scavone, 1995--2021.

    the filter zeros are placed at z = 1, z = -1, and the coefficients
    are then normalized to produce a constant unity peak gain
    (independent of the filter \e gain parameter).  The resulting
    filter frequency response has a resonance at the given \e
    frequency.  The closer the poles are to the unit-circle (\e radius
    close to one), the narrower the resulting resonance width.
    An unstable filter will result for \e radius >= 1.0.  The
