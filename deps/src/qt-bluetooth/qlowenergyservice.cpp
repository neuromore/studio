    \class QLowEnergyService
    \inmodule QtBluetooth
    \brief The QLowEnergyService class represents an individual service
    on a Bluetooth Low Energy Device.

    \since 5.4

    QLowEnergyService provides access to the details of Bluetooth Low Energy
    services. The class facilitates the discovery and publification of
    service details, permits reading and writing of the contained data
    and notifies about data changes.

    \section1 Service Structure

    A Bluetooth Low Energy peripheral device can contain multiple services.
    In turn each service may include further services. This class represents a
    single service of the peripheral device and is created via
    \l QLowEnergyController::createServiceObject(). The \l type() indicates
    whether this service is a primary (top-level) service or whether the
    service is part of another service. Each service may contain one or more
    characteristics and each characteristic may contain descriptors. The
    resulting structure may look like the following diagram:

    \image peripheral-structure.png Structure of a generic peripheral

    A characteristic is the principal information carrier. It has a
    \l {QLowEnergyCharacteristic::value()}{value()} and
    \l {QLowEnergyCharacteristic::value()}{properties()}
    describing the access permissions for the value. The general purpose
    of the contained descriptor is to further define the nature of the
    characteristic. For example, it might specify how the value is meant to be
    interpreted or whether it can notify the value consumer about value
    changes.

    \section1 Service Interaction

    Once a service object was created for the first time, its details are yet to
    be discovered. This is indicated by its current \l state() being \l DiscoveryRequired.
    It is only possible to retrieve the \l serviceUuid() and \l serviceName().

    The discovery of its included services, characteristics and descriptors
    is triggered when calling \l discoverDetails(). During the discovery the
    \l state() transitions from \l DiscoveryRequired via \l DiscoveringServices
    to its final \l ServiceDiscovered state. This transition is advertised via
    the \l stateChanged() signal. Once the details are known, all of the contained
    characteristics, descriptors and included services are known and can be read
    or written.

    The values of characteristics and descriptors can be retrieved via
    \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic and \l QLowEnergyDescriptor, respectively.
    However, direct reading or writing of these attributes requires the service object.
    The \l readCharacteristic() function attempts to re-read the value of a characteristic.
    Although the initial service discovery may have obtained a value already this call may
    be required in cases where the characteristic value constantly changes without
    any notifications being provided. An example might be a time characteristic
    that provides a continuous value. If the read attempt is successful, the
    \l characteristicRead() signal is emitted. A failure to read the value triggers
    the \l CharacteristicReadError.
    The \l writeCharacteristic() function attempts to write a new value to the given
    characteristic. If the write attempt is successful, the \l characteristicWritten()
    signal is emitted. A failure to write triggers the \l CharacteristicWriteError.
    Reading and writing of descriptors follows the same pattern.

    Every attempt is made to read or write the value of a descriptor
    or characteristic on the hardware. This means that meta information such as
    \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::properties() is generally ignored when reading and writing.
    As an example, it is possible to call \l writeCharacteristic() despite the characteristic
    being read-only based on its meta data description. The resulting write request is
    forwarded to the connected device and it is up to the device to respond to the
    potentially invalid request. In this case the result is the emission of the
    \l CharacteristicWriteError in response to the returned device error. This behavior
    simplifies interaction with devices which report wrong meta information.
    If it was not possible to forward the request to the remote device the
    \l OperationError is set. A potential reason could be that the to-be-written
    characteristic object does not even belong the current service. In
    summary, the two types of errors permit a quick distinction of local
    and remote error cases.

    All requests are serialised based on First-In First-Out principle.
    For example, issuing a second write request, before the previous
    write request has finished, is delayed until the first write request has finished.

    \note Currently, it is not possible to send signed write or reliable write requests.

    \target notifications

    In some cases the peripheral generates value updates which
    the central is interested in receiving. In order for a characteristic to support
    such notifications it must have the \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::Notify or
    \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::Indicate property and a descriptor of type
    \l QBluetoothUuid::ClientCharacteristicConfiguration. Provided those conditions
    are fulfilled notifications can be enabled as shown in the following code segment:

    \snippet doc_src_qtbluetooth.cpp enable_btle_notifications

    The example shows a battery level characteristic which updates the central
    on every value change. The notifications are provided via
    the \l characteristicChanged() signal. More details about this mechanism
    are provided by the
    \l {https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/descriptors/Pages/DescriptorViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.descriptor.gatt.client_characteristic_configuration.xml}{Bluetooth Specification}.

    \section1 Service Data Sharing

    Each QLowEnergyService instance shares its internal states and information
    with other QLowEnergyService instance of the same service. If one instance
    initiates the discovery of the service details, all remaining instances
    automatically follow. Therefore the following snippet always works:

    \snippet doc_src_qtbluetooth.cpp data_share_qlowenergyservice

    Other operations such as calls to \l readCharacteristic(), \l readDescriptor(), \l writeCharacteristic(),
    \l writeDescriptor() or the invalidation of the service due to the
    related \l QLowEnergyController disconnecting from the device are shared
    the same way.

    \enum QLowEnergyService::ServiceType

    This enum describes the type of the service.

    \value PrimaryService       The service is a top-level/primary service.
                                If this type flag is not set, the service is considered
                                to be a secondary service. Each service may be included
                                by another service which is indicated by IncludedService.
    \value IncludedService      The service is included by another service.
                                On some platforms, this flag cannot be determined until
                                the service that includes the current service was
                                discovered.
*/

/*!
    \enum QLowEnergyService::ServiceError

    This enum describes all possible error conditions during the service's
    existence. The \l error() function returns the last occurred error.

    \value NoError                  No error has occurred.
    \value OperationError           An operation was attempted while the service was not ready.
                                    An example might be the attempt to write to
                                    the service while it was not yet in the
                                    \l ServiceDiscovered \l state() or the service is invalid
                                    due to a loss of connection to the peripheral device.
    \value CharacteristicReadError  An attempt to read a characteristic value failed. For example,
                                    it might be triggered in response to a call to
                                    \l readCharacteristic(). This value was introduced by Qt 5.5.
    \value CharacteristicWriteError An attempt to write a new value to a characteristic
                                    failed. For example, it might be triggered when attempting
                                    to write to a read-only characteristic.
    \value DescriptorReadError      An attempt to read a descriptor value failed. For example,
                                    it might be triggered in response to a call to
                                    \l readDescriptor(). This value was introduced by Qt 5.5.
    \value DescriptorWriteError     An attempt to write a new value to a descriptor
                                    failed. For example, it might be triggered when attempting
                                    to write to a read-only descriptor.
    \value UnknownError             An unknown error occurred when interacting with the service.
                                    This value was introduced by Qt 5.5.

/*!
    \enum QLowEnergyService::ServiceState

    This enum describes the \l state() of the service object.

    \value InvalidService       A service can become invalid when it looses
                                the connection to the underlying device. Even though
                                the connection may be lost it retains its last information.
                                An invalid service cannot become valid anymore even if
                                the connection to the device is re-established.
    \value DiscoveryRequired    The service details are yet to be discovered by calling \l discoverDetails().
                                The only reliable pieces of information are its
                                \l serviceUuid() and \l serviceName().
    \value DiscoveringServices  The service details are being discovered.
    \value ServiceDiscovered    The service details have been discovered.
    \value LocalService         The service is associated with a controller object in the
                                \l{QLowEnergyController::PeripheralRole}{peripheral role}. Such
                                service objects do not change their state.

/*!
  \enum QLowEnergyService::WriteMode

  This enum describes the mode to be used when writing a characteristic value.
  The characteristic advertises its supported write modes via its
  \l {QLowEnergyCharacteristic::properties()}{properties}.

  \value WriteWithResponse      If a characteristic is written using this mode, the peripheral
                                shall send a write confirmation. If the operation is
                                successful, the confirmation is emitted via the
                                \l characteristicWritten() signal. Otherwise the
                                \l CharacteristicWriteError is emitted.
                                A characteristic must have set the
                                \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::Write property to support this
                                write mode.

  \value WriteWithoutResponse   If a characteristic is written using this mode, the remote peripheral
                                shall not send a write confirmation. The operation's success
                                cannot be determined and the payload must not be longer than 20 bytes.
                                A characteristic must have set the
                                \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::WriteNoResponse property to support this
                                write mode. Its adavantage is a quicker
                                write operation as it may happen in between other
                                device interactions.

  \value WriteSigned            If a characteristic is written using this mode, the remote peripheral
                                shall not send a write confirmation. The operation's success
                                cannot be determined and the payload must not be longer than 8 bytes.
                                A bond must exist between the two devices and the link must not be
                                encrypted.
                                A characteristic must have set the
                                \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::WriteSigned property to support this
                                write mode.
                                This value was introduced in Qt 5.7 and is currently only
                                supported on Android and on Linux with BlueZ 5 and a kernel version

    \b {Central role}

    The call results in a write request or command to a remote peripheral.
    If the operation is successful,
    the \l characteristicWritten() signal is emitted; otherwise the \l CharacteristicWriteError
    is set. Calling this function does not trigger the a \l characteristicChanged()
    signal unless the peripheral itself changes the value again after the current write request.

    The \a mode parameter determines whether the remote device should send a write
    confirmation. The to-be-written \a characteristic must support the relevant
    write mode. The characteristic's supported write modes are indicated by its
    \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::Write and \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::WriteNoResponse
    properties.

    All descriptor and characteristic write requests towards the same remote device are
    serialised. A queue is employed when issuing multiple write requests at the same time.
    The queue does not eliminate duplicated write requests for the same characteristic.
    For example, if the same descriptor is set to the value A and immediately afterwards
    to B, the two write request are executed in the given order.

    \note Currently, it is not possible to use signed or reliable writes as defined by the
    Bluetooth specification.

    A characteristic can only be written if this service is in the \l ServiceDiscovered state
    and belongs to the service. If one of these conditions is
    not true the \l QLowEnergyService::OperationError is set.

    \note Calling this function despite \l QLowEnergyCharacteristic::properties() reporting
    a non-writable property always attempts to write to the hardware.
    Similarly, a \l WriteWithoutResponse is sent to the hardware too although the
    characteristic may only support \l WriteWithResponse. If the hardware returns
    with an error the \l CharacteristicWriteError is set.

    \b {Peripheral role}

    The call results in the value of the characteristic getting updated in the local database.

    If a client is currently connected and it has enabled notifications or indications for
    the characteristic, the respective information will be sent.
    If a device has enabled notifications or indications for the characteristic and that device
    is currently not connected, but a bond exists between it and the local device, then
    the notification or indication will be sent on the next reconnection.

    If there is a constraint on the length of the characteristic value and \a newValue
    does not adhere to that constraint, the behavior is unspecified.

    \note The \a mode argument is ignored in peripheral mode.
