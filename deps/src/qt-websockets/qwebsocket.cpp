    \class QWebSocket

    \inmodule QtWebSockets
    \since 5.3
    \brief Implements a TCP socket that talks the WebSocket protocol.

    WebSockets is a web technology providing full-duplex communications channels over
    a single TCP connection.
    The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as
    \l {RFC 6455} in 2011.
    QWebSocket can both be used in a client application and server application.

    This class was modeled after QAbstractSocket.

    QWebSocket currently does not support
    \l {WebSocket Extensions} and
    \l {WebSocket Subprotocols}.

    QWebSocket only supports version 13 of the WebSocket protocol, as outlined in
    \l {RFC 6455}.

    \note Some proxies do not understand certain HTTP headers used during a WebSocket handshake.
    In that case, non-secure WebSocket connections fail. The best way to mitigate against
    this problem is to use WebSocket over a secure connection.

    \warning To generate masks, this implementation of WebSockets uses the reasonably
    secure QRandomGenerator::global()->generate() function.
    For more information about the importance of good masking,
    see \l {"Talking to Yourself for Fun and Profit" by Lin-Shung Huang et al}.
    The best measure against attacks mentioned in the document above,
    is to use QWebSocket over a secure connection (\e wss://).
    In general, always be careful to not have 3rd party script access to
    a QWebSocket in your application.

    \title QWebSocket client example
    \brief A sample WebSocket client that sends a message and displays the message that
    it receives back.

    \section1 Description
    The EchoClient example implements a WebSocket client that sends a message to a WebSocket server
    and dumps the answer that it gets back.
    This example should ideally be used with the EchoServer example.
    \section1 Code
    We start by connecting to the `connected()` signal.
    \snippet echoclient/echoclient.cpp constructor
    After the connection, we open the socket to the given \a url.

    \snippet echoclient/echoclient.cpp onConnected
    When the client is connected successfully, we connect to the `onTextMessageReceived()` signal,
    and send out "Hello, world!".
    If connected with the EchoServer, we will receive the same message back.

    \snippet echoclient/echoclient.cpp onTextMessageReceived
    Whenever a message is received, we write it out.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QWebSocket::connected()
  \brief Emitted when a connection is successfully established.
  A connection is successfully established when the socket is connected
  and the handshake was successful.

*/
/*!
  \fn void QWebSocket::disconnected()
  \brief Emitted when the socket is disconnected.
  \sa close(), connected()
*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::aboutToClose()

    This signal is emitted when the socket is about to close.
    Connect this signal if you have operations that need to be performed before the socket closes
    (e.g., if you have data in a separate buffer that needs to be written to the device).

    \sa close()
 */
/*!
\fn void QWebSocket::proxyAuthenticationRequired(const QNetworkProxy &proxy, QAuthenticator *authenticator)

This signal can be emitted when a \a proxy that requires
authentication is used. The \a authenticator object can then be
filled in with the required details to allow authentication and
continue the connection.

\note It is not possible to use a QueuedConnection to connect to
this signal, as the connection will fail if the authenticator has
not been filled in with new information when the signal returns.

\sa QAuthenticator, QNetworkProxy
*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::stateChanged(QAbstractSocket::SocketState state);

    This signal is emitted whenever QWebSocket's state changes.
    The \a state parameter is the new state.

    \note QAbstractSocket::ConnectedState is emitted after the handshake
    with the server has succeeded.

    QAbstractSocket::SocketState is not a registered metatype, so for queued
    connections, you will have to register it with Q_REGISTER_METATYPE() and
    qRegisterMetaType().

    \fn void QWebSocket::readChannelFinished()

    This signal is emitted when the input (reading) stream is closed in this device.
    It is emitted as soon as the closing is detected.

    \sa close()
*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::bytesWritten(qint64 bytes)

    This signal is emitted every time a payload of data has been written to the socket.
    The \a bytes argument is set to the number of bytes that were written in this payload.

    \note This signal has the same meaning both for secure and non-secure WebSockets.
    As opposed to QSslSocket, bytesWritten() is only emitted when encrypted data is effectively
    written (see QSslSocket::encryptedBytesWritten()).
    \sa close()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::textFrameReceived(const QString &frame, bool isLastFrame);

    This signal is emitted whenever a text frame is received. The \a frame contains the data and
    \a isLastFrame indicates whether this is the last frame of the complete message.

    This signal can be used to process large messages frame by frame, instead of waiting for the
    complete message to arrive.

    \sa binaryFrameReceived()
*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::binaryFrameReceived(const QByteArray &frame, bool isLastFrame);

    This signal can be used to process large messages frame by frame, instead of waiting for the

    received bytes.

*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::error(QAbstractSocket::SocketError error);

    This signal is emitted after an error occurred. The \a error
    parameter describes the type of error that occurred.

    QAbstractSocket::SocketError is not a registered metatype, so for queued
    connections, you will have to register it with Q_DECLARE_METATYPE() and
    qRegisterMetaType().

    \sa error(), errorString()
*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::sslErrors(const QList<QSslError> &errors)
    QWebSocket emits this signal after the SSL handshake to indicate that one or more errors have
    occurred while establishing the identity of the peer.
    The errors are usually an indication that QWebSocket is unable to securely identify the peer.
    Unless any action is taken, the connection will be dropped after this signal has been emitted.
    If you want to continue connecting despite the errors that have occurred, you must call
    QWebSocket::ignoreSslErrors() from inside a slot connected to this signal.
    If you need to access the error list at a later point, you can call sslErrors()
    (without arguments).

    \a errors contains one or more errors that prevent QWebSocket from verifying the identity of
    the peer.

    \note You cannot use Qt::QueuedConnection when connecting to this signal, or calling
    QWebSocket::ignoreSslErrors() will have no effect.
*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::preSharedKeyAuthenticationRequired(QSslPreSharedKeyAuthenticator *authenticator)
    \since 5.8

    This signal is emitted if the SSL/TLS handshake negotiates a PSK
    ciphersuite, and therefore a PSK authentication is then required.

    When using PSK, the client must send to the server a valid identity and a
    valid pre shared key, in order for the SSL handshake to continue.
    Applications can provide this information in a slot connected to this
    signal, by filling in the passed \a authenticator object according to their
    needs.

    \note Ignoring this signal, or failing to provide the required credentials,
    will cause the handshake to fail, and therefore the connection to be aborted.

    \note The \a authenticator object is owned by the websocket and must not be
    deleted by the application.

    payload that was sent with the ping.
