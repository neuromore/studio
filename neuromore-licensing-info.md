# neuromore Licensing

_We believe an open development approach leads to more valuable, robust and secure software, and it directly enables a stronger community and better products for consumers and patients._

neuromore studio is **dual-licensed** under commercial and open source licenses. 

## neuromore Commercial License

The commercial neuromore license gives you the full rights to create and distribute software on your own terms without any open source license obligations. With the commercial license you also have access to official neuromore Support and a close strategic relationship with neuromore to make sure your development goals are met.

**To obtain a commercial license please contact neuromore via *[https://neuromore.com/contact/](https://neuromore.com/contact/)*.**

As an alternative to contacting neuromore and negotiating a license for use of the Program you may notify the Company that you or an Affiliate will be using the Program for Commercial Purposes and then pay to the Company a royalty of fifteen percent (15%) of Net Revenue earned by you or an Affiliate (Net Revenue meaning gross revenues minus returns and credits). On a quarterly basis you shall provide neuromore with a calculation of royalties due and a sheet showing how such amount was calculated together with the amount due in US dollars. You agree that neuromore, or its agent may, subject to signing a reasonable confidentiality agreement and no more than once per year, audit your financial records as is reasonably necessary to confirm royalties due. All royalties will be calculated in US dollars. Any license for Commercial Purposes will be under the terms and conditions located at *[neuromore.com/end-user-agreement](https://neuromore.com/end-user-agreement)*.

## neuromore Public License

neuromore studio is available under the *[neuromore Public License](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/neuromore-public-license.md)*.

**You may not use Program for any use intended to generate any value to you or an Affiliate, whether cash, credit, services or any other item (physical or not) which a typical user of the Program would consider to have “value”.**

The neuromore Public License ("NPL") is ideal for use cases such as open source projects with open source distribution, student/academic purposes, hobby projects, internal research projects without external distribution, or other projects where all NPL obligations can be met. The NPL also includes a provision for commercial use whereby you can revenue share with neuromore without negotiating Enterprise licensing terms. We hope this encourages use for startups and practitioners getting started who might start offering services commercially but don't want to spend time thinking about licensing.

When deciding which license to use, please check your corporate open source policy or consult a software licensing legal expert.

## What specifically is the difference between AGPL and the neuromore Public License?
*[Click here to view GNU's AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.de.html)*

The only substantive modification is section 18.

Section 18 clarifies, that the neuromore Public License is only available for non-commercial purposes. If you intend to use the Program for commercial purposes, you may contact neuromore via *[https://neuromore.com/contact/](https://neuromore.com/contact/)*. As an alternative to contacting neuromore and negotiating a license for use of the Program you may notify the Company that you will be using the Program for Commercial Purposes and then pay to the Company a royalty of fifteen percent (15%) of Net Revenue (Net Revenue meaning gross revenues minus returns and credits).

## What is the neuromore Class Exception?
*[Click here to view neuromore Class Exception](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/neuromore-class-exception.md)*

The neuromore Class Exception enables you to extend neuromore Studio and Engine by implementing the custom node interfaces without causing the resulting work to be covered by the NPL. This protects your IP and lets you decide how you license it, whether it's commercial or in the public domain.
