# neuromore Studio

Build state-of-the-art neurofeedback applications with ease using neuromore Studio!

Our node-based IDE supports a wide variety of biosensors like EEG headsets (e.g. OpenBCI boards, Interaxonâ€™s Muse and devices supported by the Brainflow API), heart rate monitors, and bluetooth devices that you can effortlessly connect to your applications.

Create audio or visual experiences within neuromore Studio or make your application control your Unity game, your favorite audio production, or your visualizer of choice using the Open Sound Control protocol. The only limit is our imagination!

## Building

We provide two integrated build environments in this repository:

- [Visual Studio](#visual-studio) solution for intuitive Windows development using MSVC++ as compiler
- [GNU Makefiles](#gnu-make-clang) for building with Clang/LLVM on multiple platforms

### Visual Studio

_Folder:_ [/build/vs](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/tree/master/build/vs)

_Requirements:_

- Visual Studio 2019 (default) or 2017 (old)
- Installed VS-Feature: Desktop Development (C/MSVC++ tools/components)
- Installed VS-Feature: Windows 10 SDK (any version, the later the better)

_Steps:_

- Open [Neuromore.sln](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/build/vs/Neuromore.sln) in Visual Studio
- For VS2017: Manually downgrade project platformtoolset from v142 (2019) to v141 (2017)
- For VS2017: Manually set a Win 10 SDK version that you have installed
- Build the "Studio" project in release mode or start it directly in debug mode

_Configurations:_

| Name       | Optimized | Debuggable | Logging | Notes                          |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Debug      | No        | Yes        | Max     |                                |
| Release    | Yes       | No         | Medium  | Also called DEVELOPMENT        |
| Production | Yes       | No         | Min     | Release + PRODUCTION_BUILD set |

_Build Output Studio:_

| Arch | Folder            |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| x86  | /build/vs/bin/x86 |
| x64  | /build/vs/bin/x64 |

_Notes:_

- Creates portable, stand-alone executable not requiring any special DLLs
- Runs on Windows 7 and above

### GNU Make + Clang

This is our multi-platform build environment based on [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).

It supports the following platforms:

- Windows
- Linux
- Mac OSX

#### Prerequisites

##### Linux (Ubuntu)

_Get the required build tools:_

```
sudo apt-get install make clang llvm lld
```

_Verify the build tool versions:_

```
make -v
clang++ -v
ar
```

_Get the required development packages of linked libraries:_

```
sudo apt-get install \
 libgstreamer1.0-dev \
 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
 libgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-dev \
 libglib2.0-dev \
 libgl1-mesa-dev \
 libglu1-mesa-dev \
 libsm-dev \
 libx11-dev \
 libx11-xcb-dev \
 libexpat-dev \
 libxkbcommon-dev \
 libxcb1-dev \
 libxcb-glx0-dev \
 libxcb-icccm4-dev \
 libxcb-image0-dev \
 libxcb-keysyms1-dev \
 libxcb-randr0-dev \
 libxcb-render0-dev \
 libxcb-render-util0-dev \
 libxcb-shape0-dev \
 libxcb-shm0-dev \
 libxcb-sync-dev \
 libxcb-xfixes0-dev \
 libxcb-xinerama0-dev \
 libxcb-xkb-dev \
 libxcb-util-dev
```

##### Mac OSX

_Install these_

```
Xcode
Xcode Command Line Tools
```

_Verify the build tool versions:_

```
make -v
clang++ -v
ar
```

##### Windows

- We recommend to use Visual Studio on Windows, not Clang.
- Visual Studio is still required to build with Clang on Windows (linking VC runtime).
- Requires GNU Make for Windows, Clang for Windows and LLVM for Windows (TODO: Links)

#### Building (all platforms)

_Building third party dependencies:_

```
cd deps/build/make
make
```

_Building Studio:_

```
cd build/make
make
```

_Cleaning third party dependencies:_

```
cd deps/build/make
make clean
```

_Cleaning Studio:_

```
cd build/make
make clean
```

_Building with custom parameters:_

```
cd deps/build/make
make all-x64 -f Makefile.linux -j 4
```

_Notes:_

- Building without parameters will build for your current os, arch and cpu cores count
- Building the dependencies is only required once (or when they change, which doesn't occur often)
- Custom: Replace 'linux' in 'Makefile.linux' by 'windows' or 'osx' to build on Windows or OSX
- Custom: Replace 'x64' by 'x86' to build the 32 Bit version instead of 64 Bit
- Custom: Replace '4' in '-j 4' by the number of cores you want to use for compilation

_Build Output Studio:_

| Arch | Folder              |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| x86  | /build/make/bin/x86 |
| x64  | /build/make/bin/x64 |

_Build Output Dependencies:_

| Arch | Folder                   |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| x86  | /deps/build/make/lib/x86 |
| x64  | /deps/build/make/lib/x64 |

#### Customizing the Build

- Using preprocessor C/C++ macro defines.
- Set in Config.h files or in build environment.

##### General

| Macro/Define     | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| PRODUCTION_BUILD | Tweaks builds for production instead of development usage |

##### Engine Devices

- Configure in Engine [Config.h](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/src/Engine/Config.h)
- Enabling these requires proprietary contents from compatible SDK versions at compile/link/run time
- Compile-Time: Headers from SDK go to: /deps/include/some-device/
- Link-Time: Prebuilt proprietary Libs from SDK go to: /deps/prebuilt/win/x86/ (respectively /linux/ or /x64/)
- Run-Time: Prebuilt proprietary DLLs from SDK go to wherever you place and start your Studio.exe from

## FAQ

### Technical

_Q:_ Can I build an offline version of neurmore studio (one that does not require your backend)?
_A_: This is a work in progress. We don't provide an option for that. For now, access to our backend is mandatory.

_Q:_ Is the backend code included or available so that I can host it myself?
_A_: No. The backend code and database design is not included in this repository.

_Q:_ How do I reset my password?
_A:_ https://account.neuromore.com/#/login
