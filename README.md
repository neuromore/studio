### Dependencies

See [this](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/deps/README.md) for more information about the third party software included in this repository.

## Building

We provide two integrated build environments in this repository:

* Visual Studio solution for intuitive Windows development using MSVC++ as compiler
* GNU Makefiles for building with Clang/LLVM on multiple platforms

### Visual Studio

*Folder:* [/build/vs](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/tree/master/build/vs)

*Requirements:*
* Visual Studio 2019 (default) or 2017 (old)
* Installed VS-Feature: Desktop Development (C/MSVC++ tools/components)
* Installed VS-Feature: Windows 10 SDK (any version, the later the better)

*Steps:*
* Open [Neuromore.sln](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/build/vs/Neuromore.sln) in Visual Studio
* For VS2017: Manually downgrade project platformtoolset from v142 (2019) to v141 (2017)
* For VS2017: Manually set a Win 10 SDK version that you have installed
* Build the "Studio" project in release mode or start it directly in debug mode

*Configurations:*

| Name        | Optimized | Debuggable | Logging | Notes                          |
|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| Debug       | No        | Yes        | Max     |                                |
| Release     | Yes       | No         | Medium  | Also called DEVELOPMENT        |
| Production  | Yes       | No         | Min     | Release + PRODUCTION_BUILD set |

*Build Output Studio:*

| Arch | Folder            |
|------|-------------------|
| x86  | /build/vs/bin/x86 |
| x64  | /build/vs/bin/x64 |

*Notes:*

* Creates portable, stand-alone executable not requiring any special DLLs
* Runs on Windows 7 and above

### GNU Make + Clang + LLVM

This is our multi-platform build environment based on [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

It supports the following platforms:

* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OSX

#### General

*Building third party dependencies:*

```
cd deps/build/make
make all-x64 -f Makefile.linux -j 4
```

*Building Studio:*

```
cd build/make
make Studio-x64 -f Makefile.linux -j 4
```

*Cleaning third party dependencies:*

```
cd deps/build/make
make clean -f Makefile.linux -j 4
```

*Cleaning Studio:*

```
cd build/make
make clean -f Makefile.linux -j 4
```

*Notes:*

* Replace 'linux' in 'Makefile.linux' by 'windows' or 'osx' to build on Windows or OSX
* Replace 'x64' by 'x86' to build the 32 Bit version instead of 64 Bit
* Replace '4' in '-j 4' by the number of cores you want to use for compilation
* Building the dependencies is only required once (or when they change, which doesn't occur often)

*Build Output Studio:*

| Arch | Folder              |
|------|---------------------|
| x86  | /build/make/bin/x86 |
| x64  | /build/make/bin/x64 |

*Build Output Dependencies:*

| Arch | Folder                   |
|------|--------------------------|
| x86  | /deps/build/make/lib/x86 |
| x64  | /deps/build/make/lib/x64 |

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

*Get the required build tools:*

```
sudo apt-get install make clang llvm
```

*Verify the build tool versions:*

```
make -v
clang++ -v
llvm-ar -version
```

*Get the required development packages of linked libraries:*

```
sudo apt-get install \
 libgl1-mesa-dev \
 libglu1-mesa-dev \
 libsm-dev \
 libx11-dev \
 libx11-xcb-dev \
 libexpat-dev \
 libxkbcommon-dev \
 libxcb1-dev \
 libxcb-glx0-dev \
 libxcb-icccm4-dev \
 libxcb-image0-dev \
 libxcb-keysyms1-dev \
 libxcb-randr0-dev \
 libxcb-render0-dev \
 libxcb-render-util0-dev \
 libxcb-shape0-dev \
 libxcb-shm0-dev \
 libxcb-sync-dev \
 libxcb-xfixes0-dev \
 libxcb-xinerama0-dev \
 libxcb-xkb-dev \
 libxcb-util-dev
```

#### Mac OSX

*Install these*

```
Xcode
Xcode Command Line Tools
```

*Verify the build tool versions:*

```
make -v
clang++ -v
ar
```

#### Windows

* We recommend to use Visual Studio on Windows, not Clang.
* Visual Studio is still required to build with Clang on Windows (linking VC runtime).
* Requires GNU Make for Windows, Clang for Windows and LLVM for Windows (TODO: Links)

### Customizing the Build

* Using preprocessor C/C++ macro defines.
* Set in Config.h files or in build environment.

#### General

| Macro/Define      | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| PRODUCTION_BUILD  | Tweaks builds for production instead of development usage |

#### Engine Devices

* Configure in Engine [Config.h](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/src/Engine/Config.h)
* Enabling these requires proprietary contents from compatible SDK versions at compile/link/run time
* Compile-Time: Headers from SDK go to: /deps/include/some-device/
* Link-Time: Prebuilt proprietary Libs from SDK go to: /deps/prebuilt/win/x86/ (respectively /linux/ or /x64/)
* Run-Time: Prebuilt proprietary DLLs from SDK go to wherever you place and start your Studio.exe from

| INCLUDE_DEVICE_ACTICHAMP               | ?        | ActiChamp EEG                      |

#### Studio Features

* Configure in Studio [Config.h](https://github.com/neuromore/studio/blob/master/src/Studio/Config.h)

| Macro/Define            | Description                                              |

## FAQ

### Technical

*Q:* Can I build an offline version of neurmore studio (one that does not require your backend)?
*A*: This is a work in progress. We don't provide an option for that. For now, access to our backend is mandatory.

*Q:* Is the backend code included or available so that I can host it myself?
*A*: No. The backend code and database design is not included in this repository.

*Q:* How do I reset my password?
*A:* https://account.neuromore.com/#/login
